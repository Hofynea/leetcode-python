121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Intuition:
To maximize profit, we want to buy at the lowest price before selling at the highest price.
By scanning prices from left to right, we can keep track of the lowest price seen so far.

Approach:
1. Initialize `min_price` to infinity and `max_profit` to 0.
2. Iterate over the prices:
   - If current price < `min_price`, update `min_price`.
   - Otherwise, calculate potential profit and update `max_profit` if itâ€™s higher.
3. Return `max_profit`.

Time Complexity:
- O(n): Single pass through the list.

Space Complexity:
- O(1): No additional space used.

Example:
Input:
    prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output:
    5  (Buy at 1, sell at 6)
